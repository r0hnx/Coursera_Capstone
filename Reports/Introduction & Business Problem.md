# Predicting the Severity of a Car Accident Using Seattle Collision Data

## Introduction

Car road accidents are the number one problem in US road transportation, accounting for 99% of transportation injuries and representing an economic cost of 150 billion USD annually. Deaths and injuries from the accidents are some of the issues concerned by **insurance companies, healthcare institutions and governments**. Itâ€™s very important for them to be able to predict the severity rate of an accident given some known variables. This project will attempt to employ classification models to predict severity rates and compare the accuracy of each built model.

## Business Problem

Predicting car accidents severity is one of the biggest challenges faced by many actors. No single factor can help in explaining the severity of an accident, and the relationship between these factors, although intuitively positive, are mostly unclear from a statistical point of view. But while each accident may be unique, accumulating insights from each accident may show macro trends and thus allow us to make accurate predictions that might aid the actors in their decision-making processes. Taking these several seemly uncorrelated variables into a single accurate prediction model is a long process that requires finding generalizable predictive patterns. That can only be achieved by using machine learning algorithms.
